        <h2>Bio</h2>
        <p>
            The Mountain Goats are an American band formed in Claremont, California by singer-songwriter John Darnielle. 
            The band is currently based in Durham, North Carolina. For many years, the sole member of the Mountain Goats 
            was Darnielle, despite the plural moniker. Although he remains the core member of the band, he has worked with 
            a variety of collaborators over time, including bassist and vocalist Peter Hughes, drummer Jon Wurster, 
            multi-instrumentalist Matt Douglas, singer-songwriter Franklin Bruno, bassist and vocalist Rachel Ware, 
            singer-songwriter/producer John Vanderslice, guitarist Kaki King, and multi-instrumentalist Annie Clark.
            Throughout the 1990s, the Mountain Goats were known for producing low-fidelity home recordings (most notably, 
            on a cassette deck boombox) and releasing recordings in cassette or vinyl 7" formats. Since 2002, the Mountain 
            Goats have adopted a more polished approach, recording studio albums with a full band, while still maintaining
            organically emotional lyrical motifs.
